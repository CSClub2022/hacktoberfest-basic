> **_Following are the criteria for checking the password:_**

- **_At least 1 letter between [a-z]_**
- **_At least 1 number between [0-9]_**
- **_At least 1 letter between [A-Z]_**
- **_At least 1 character from [$#@]_**
- **_Minimum length of transaction password: 6_**
- **_Maximum length of transaction password: 12_**

### 13. Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.
### 14. Define a function that can convert a integer into a string and print it in console.
### 15. Define a function that can receive two integer numbers in string form and compute their sum and then print it in console.
### 16. Define a function that can accept two strings as input and concatenate them and then print it in console.
### 17. Define a function that can accept two strings as input and print the string with maximum length in console. If two strings have the same length, then the function should print all strings line by line.
### 18. Define a function which can generate and print an array where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).
### 19. Given an array of n elements that contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any of these numbers appearing any number of times. Find these repeating numbers in O(n) and using only constant memory space.
### 20. You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in the list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.
### 21. Given two sorted arrays, the task is to merge them in a sorted manner.
### 22. Given an unsorted array of nonnegative integers, find a continuous subarray which adds to a given number.
### 23. Write an efficient program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum.
### 24. Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
### 25. Design a stack that supports getMin() in O(1) time and O(1) extra space.
### 26. Given an array and an integer K, find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size k.
### 27. Inversion Count for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If the array is already sorted, then the inversion count is 0, but if the array is sorted in the reverse order, the inversion count is the maximum. Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j 
### 28. Given a stack, sort it using recursion. Use of any loop constructs like while, for .etc is not allowed. We can only use the ADT functions on Stack 
### 29. Write a function rotate(ar[], d, n) that rotates arr[] of size n by d elements. n can be greater than d or lesser than d.
### 30. For a given array count combination of pairs of (x,y) whose sum is N.
### 31. Find the contiguous sub-array in an array which has the largest sum
### 32. Implement Radix Sort
### 33. Implement Bucket Sort
### 34. Implement Bogo Sort
### 35. Implement Quantum Sort
### 36. Given two strings, determine if they are isomorphic
### 37. Generate a list of all permutation of a string
### 38. Implement Counting Sort
### 39. Given a string, determine the length of the longest substring which does not have duplicated characters
### 40. Write a program to multiply two matrices (Assume they are compatible).
### 41. Write a program to check if entered vectors are linearly independent.
